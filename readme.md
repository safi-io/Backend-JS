# Overview
I Learned Backend in JS during my first summer vacations of University.
# Technologies
- Node
- Express
- Mongo
# Details
I organized all folders with concept names. So, in future I can easily revise any concept.
# Projects
I tried my best to use every single concept I learned in projects for better understandings.
# Reason
I made this public, So everyone can get a roadmap to how to learn backend the way I did.
